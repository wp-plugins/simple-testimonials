Easily manage testimonials and display them anywhere on your blog in seconds, via widgets and shortcodes. Instructions are baked right in!

== Description ==

I created this plugin to make it easy peasy for my clients to manage all the nice things that _their_ customers and clients said about them. They've loved it so much, I've decided to make it available to the world.

When you install it, you will gain a new section in your wordpress admin where you can easily create and manage all your testimonials. It's extremely similar to creating a new post or page. Just go to the testimonial section, click "Add new", and follow the on-screen prompts. That's it. When you're done, you can get a random testimonial to display each time a page loads with the handy included widget, or the shortcode [testimonial]. Phew, easy peasy!

This plugin is perfect for you if:

*	You want to establish credibility on every page, not just a single testimonials page.
*	You want to manage everything in one place, instead of having to update a separate testimonials page and various text widgets in your sidebars.
*	You want a testimonial page that is auto-formatted, so everything looks uniform and clean, without you having to futz around with copy-pasting code.

== Installation ==

1. Download the zip file, and unzip it.
1. Upload the entire folder (PIXELovely-testimonials) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Now, to start using it, just:

1. Add some testimonials in the new testimonial section.
1. To display the testimonials in a sidebar or other widgetized location, simply drag the widget named "Random Testimonial" to your widget area. You may open the widget panel and choose a number of testimonials to display.
1. To display the testimonials in a post or page, type the shortcode **[testimonial]** into any post or page that you like. You can display more than one testimonial at a time by specifying a number, like this: **[testimonial number=3]** Just substitute your number for my 3.
1. To create a testimonials page, where all your testimonials are shown at once, use the shortcode above, but set the number to 0. When you use 0, no limit will be used, and all of your testimonials will be shown at once.
1. If you forgot how to use the testimonial plugin at any time, I've placed a 1 page user manual directly into the testimonial section of your admin area. You're welcome! :)
